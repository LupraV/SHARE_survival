# Too Sick for Working, or Sick of Working?  
## Impact of Acute Health Shocks on Early Labour Market Exits

### Overview
This repository contains the Stata code and data preparation steps used to investigate the relationship between acute health shocks and early labour market exits among older adults (aged 50+). The study utilises data from the Survey of Health, Ageing, and Retirement in Europe (SHARE - https://share-eric.eu/) and applies survival analysis methods, including Kaplan-Meier estimators and Cox proportional hazards models.

### Key Objectives
1. Assess how acute health shocks influence the likelihood of early retirement.
2. Examine the role of acute health shocks, self-perceived health, and socioeconomic factors in labour market decisions.
3. Provide gender-specific insights to inform welfare policy and support interventions.

### Software
- **Stata/SE 17.0**

### Contents
- `Data_prep.do`: Data cleaning and transformation steps, including handling missing values and constructing variables.
- `Survival_prep.do` and `SurvivalAnalysis.do`: Kaplan-Meier and Cox Proportional Hazards model implementation.
- `Table_exports.xlsx`: Contains output tables of descriptive statistics, and Cox Proportional Hazards regression analysis.

### Data
- The study uses the SHARE dataset, covering 28 European countries and Israel. The dataset includes variables for waves 1~8.

### Key Findings
- Acute health shocks significantly increase the hazard of early labour market exits.
- Poorer self-perceived health and lower education levels are critical predictors of early retirement.
- Gender-specific patterns highlight the need for tailored policy interventions.
